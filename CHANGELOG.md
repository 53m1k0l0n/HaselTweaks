## [0.3.2] (2022-08-10)

## [0.0.1] (2022-04-23)

First release! ðŸ¥³

Starting with the following Tweaks:

###  Auto Sort Armoury Chest

Automatically runs the shared macro in the third slot when the armoury is opened. Use `/isort` in the macro.

###  Character Class Switcher

Always equips the gearset with the highest average item level.

###  Chat Timestamp Fixer

At least in the german client the game uses the format `[H:mm]` and it bugged me to have a single digit in the early mornings, so I changed it to `[HH:mm]` and added a space afterwards for better visibility.

###  DTR

Shows Instance, FPS and Busy status in DTR bar. Use Dalamud Settings to enable/disable or to change order.

### Expert Deliveries

Always opens the Grand Company Delivery Missions window on the third tab (Expert Delivery).

### Hide MSQ Complete

Hides the Main Scenario Guide when you've completed the MSQ. Job quests are still being displayed.

### Keep Instant Profile

Prevents Instant Profile from being reset upon saving/updating the current gearset.

### Keep Screen Awake

Prevents the screen from going into standby.

### Navi Map Opacity

When not hovering over the minimap this tweak applies an opacity of 80%. Also makes its collision box square, for a custom texture I use.

### Refresh Material List

Refreshes the material list and recipe tree when you've crafted or gathered an item.

### Wondrous Tails Duty Selector

Opens duty finder for the duty you clicked on in the Wondrous Tails Journal.
